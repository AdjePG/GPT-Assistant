## About the project

<p align="justify"><strong>GPT-Assistant</strong> is a website with a simple <i>intelligent assistant</i> that helps you to translate words or phrases in different languages, and generates recipes depending on what you write in the text box. This assistant is basic but every developer can add a task or utility in this project.</p>

<p align="justify">The project is divided in two main parts, which are the server side and the client side. I use React with react router, NodeJS (especifically ExpressJS) and the OpenAI API for the text and image generation</p>
